#  Smart Headlight Reminder App

An Android app that connects to a **Grove Light Sensor** via **MQTT**, reads ambient (surrounding/outdoor) light levels, and gives **voice reminders** using **Text-to-Speech** when it's too dark — helping drivers remember to turn on their headlights.

---

##  Features

-  Realtime MQTT communication with a light sensor (e.g., CC3200 + Grove Light Sensor)
-  Text-to-Speech voice prompt: “Turn on headlight”
-  Detects low light conditions and shows visual alerts
-  Modern UI built with **Jetpack Compose**
-  Powered by **Paho MQTT** client
-  Supports automatic dark/light system themes

##  MQTT Broker Configuration

### Default values in `MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
private val brokerUrl = "tcp://broker.hivemq.com:1883"
private val subscriptionTopic = "sensors/light/cc3200"
```

- Connects to the **HiveMQ public broker**
- Subscribes to topic: `sensors/light/cc3200`
- Light sensor should publish **integer light values** like `1000`, `2000`, etc.
- App triggers **voice alert** when value is below `LOW_LIGHT_THRESHOLD` (default = 1500)

### To use your own broker:

- Replace `brokerUrl` with your own (e.g. `"tcp://192.168.1.100:1883"`)
- Change `subscriptionTopic` to match your device’s topic
- Optionally adjust `LOW_LIGHT_THRESHOLD` based on your environment



##  Built With

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- [Paho MQTT Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/)
- [Material3](https://m3.material.io/)
- [TextToSpeech API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech)
